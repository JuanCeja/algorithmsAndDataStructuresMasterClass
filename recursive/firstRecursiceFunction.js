// 1. BASE CASE

// We need a base case. This is the condition when the recursion ends. This is the most important concept to understand.

// 2. DIFFERENT INPUT

// We want to call the same function over and over but each time with a different piece of data. You don't want to keep using the same data because we will never get anywhere. So we change our data and run our data again.
