// ======================================================== WHAT ARE GRAPHS ==========================================================

// A Graph is a set of nodes together with a set of pairs of these vertices, which are the connections. So we have a bunch of nodes, and then connections between them. 
// A Graph is a type of tree, but in a Graph there is no parent node, there is no starting place, there is no entry point. There just a bunch of nodes treated equally with connections between them.

// ====================================================== ESSENTIAL GRAPH TERMS ======================================================

// VERTEX - it's just a node
// EDGE - the connection between the nodes
// WEIGHTED/UNWEIGHTED - values assigned to distances between vertices
// DIRECTED/UNDIRECTED - directions assigned to distanced and between vertices



// ======================================================== USES FOR GRAPHS ==========================================================

// Social Networks, Location/Mapping, Routing Algorithms, Visual Hierarchy, File System Optimization, they are EVERYWHERE!



// ========================================================= TYPES OF GRAPHS =========================================================

// UNDIRECTED GRAPH   -   There is no direction to or polarity to the edges. They are 2 way connections.
// DIRECTED GRAPH     -   Is often represented with arrows, which indicates the direction, the polarity of that edge. 
// UNWEIGHTED GRAPH   -   Each connection(edge) between the vertices(nodes) has no value associated with it.
// WEIGHTED GRAPH     -   Each connection(edge) between the vertices(nodes) has a value associated with it. When we assign a value to the 
//                        edges, it becomes a weighted graph. There is information about the connection itself
