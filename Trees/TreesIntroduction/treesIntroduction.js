// ======================= WHAT IS A TREE ? ========================

// A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship. 

// ======================= TREE TERMINOLOGY ========================

// ROOT - The top node in a tree
// CHILD - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
// PARENT - The converse notion of a child
// SIBLINGS - A group of nodes with the same parent
// LEAF - A node with no children
// EDGE - The connection between one node and another

// ===================== USES FOR TREES ============================

// HTML DOM
// Network Routing
// Abstract Syntax Tree
// Artificial Intelligence
// Folders in Operating Systems
// Computer File Systems

// ===================== KINDS FOR TREES ===========================
// === that im focusing on in general ====

// Trees
// Binary Trees (Each Node can have at MOST 2 children)
// Binary Search Trees

// =============== HOW BINARY SEARCH TREES WORK ====================

// Each parent has at most 2 children
// Every node to the left of a parent node is ALWAYS LESS than the parent
// Every node the right of a parent node is ALWAYS GREATER than the parent
