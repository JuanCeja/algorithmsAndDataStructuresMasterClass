// ================================================================== WHAT IS DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING? ==================================================================

// A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions. 

// DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING only works on problems with OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE & OVERLAPPING SUB-PROBLEMS.

//  WHAT IS OVERLAPPING SUB-PROBLEMS? A problem is said to have overlapping sub-problems if it can be broken down into sub-problems which are re used several times. This means that we can break one problem down into smaller pieces, but some of those pieces are re-used. A good EXAMPLE would be FIBONACCI SEQUENCE, it does have overlapping sub problems.
