// Trie Exercise - addWord

// This function should add the given word starting from the given index to the Trie.

// It will be recursive and notify the correct child of this Trie to add the word starting from a later index.

// Consider what the add function should do when it reaches the end of the word as a word does not necessarily end at a leaf.

// You must mark nodes which are the ends of words so that the words can be reconstructed later.
